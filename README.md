# Talley

*Talley* is a device warranty tracker application in which users can add their electronic devices to store the device warranty period, images, vendor and other various device information. The application is intended to keep all electronic device information in one easily accessible application.

Currently, Talley is still in development. 

One of the main features if Talley that I have been trying to implement is automated notifications for when your device's warranty is about to expire. This is currently not included in this version.
